	<h1>Good vegetables for winter</h1>
	<div class="row" id="ma">
		<div class="col div1" id="one">
		<div class="h1">Carrot</div>
		<p>carrots truly shine in the winter, when cold temperatures make them 
		extra sweet. Reach for a raw carrot whenever you want a healthy snack and 
		an impressive dose of vitamin A; we also highly recommend them as a 
		nutrient-rich addition to hearty winter stews.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col div1" id="one">
		<div class="h1">Broccoli</div>
		<p>You might not think of broccoli as a winter vegetable since this 
		cruciferous vegetable can be found on the menu at any time of year. 
		That said, broccoli, like the other members of its family, does indeed 
		favor frigid temperatures, so you’ll find that this nutrient-rich,
		flowering veg has superior flavor in the winter season.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col div1" id="one">
		<div class="h1">Cauliflower</div>
		<p>Everyone likes cauliflower and it’s not hard to see why. This flowering 
		cruciferous vegetable is just like broccoli, but it’s not green so it won’t
		scare away any picky eaters, and its flavor is milder and sweeter as well.</p>
		</div>
